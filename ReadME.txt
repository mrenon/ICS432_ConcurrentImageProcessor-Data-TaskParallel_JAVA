The performance factor with 2, 4, 8 threads were significantly faster than when 1 thread was ran. The performance factor using 2 threads compared to 1 made the runtime cut down by almost half. and when 4 threads were introduced it was 3-4 times as fast. By this observation we can assume there is a correlation in which the number of threads makes the code that much times faster.

there is a significant boost between processing time because more threads work on the image instead of one thread. Whether the load balancing is fair between the threads in data parallel is another story, but as of right now we donâ€™t care because it is still faster than using one thread all together,
